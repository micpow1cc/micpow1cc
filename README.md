Here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills and interests:

1. **Automatic Training and Saving Neural Network Models**:
   - Description: Class which automates the process of training and saving neural network models with a specific        architecture (data selection based on most correlated dimentions).
   - Repository: [Automatic Training and Saving Neural Network Models](https://github.com/micpow1cc/auto_neuralnetwork_train_and_save)
  
2. **Teeth detection**:
   - Description: A Python model that detects teeth and tooth fillings using YOLOv5.
   - Repository: [Teeth detection](https://github.com/micpow1cc/Pantomograph_teeth_counting)

5. **OTODOM page web scraping**:
   - Description: A Python script that collects data from OTODOM page (price of a flat). It performs a normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) on the collected prices and visualizes the distribution using a histogram.
   - Repository: [OTODOM web scraping](https://github.com/micpow1cc/WEB_SCRAPING_OTODOM)
3. **PDF Project**:
   - Description: A Python project that extracts text from PDF files and searches for specific content.
